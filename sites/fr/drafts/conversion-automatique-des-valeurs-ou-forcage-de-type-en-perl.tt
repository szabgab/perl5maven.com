Imagine you prepare the shopping list, write on it

<code>
"2 loaves of bread"
</code>

and hand it over to your significant other who promptly
throws and invalid type conversion error in your face.
After all "2" is a string there, not a number.

That would be frustrating, wouldn't it?

<h2>Type conversion in Perl</h2>

In most of the programming languages the type of the operands define how an operator behaves.
That is, <i>adding</i> two numbers does numerical addition, while <i>adding</i> two strings together concatenates them.
This feature is called operator overloading.

Perl, mostly works in the opposite way.

In Perl, the operator is the one that defines how the operands are used.

This means if you are using a numerical operation (e.g. addition) then both values
are automatically converted to numbers. If you are using a string operation
(e.g. concatenation) then both values are automatically converted to strings.

C programmers would probably call these conversions <b>casting</b> but this is word is
not used in the Perl world. Probably because the whole thing is automatic.

Perl does not care if you write something as number or as string.
It converts between the two automatically based on the context.

The <hl>number => string</hl> conversion is easy.
It is just a matter of imaging as if "" appeared around the number value.

The <hl>string => number</hl> conversion might leave you thinking a bit.
If the string looks like a number to perl, then it is easy.
The numerical value is just the same thing. Without the quotes.

If there is any character that stops perl from fully converting the string to a
number, then perl will use as much as it can on the left hand side of the string for the
numerical value and disregard the rest.

Let me show a couple of examples:

<code>
Original   As string   As number

  42         "42"        42
  0.3        "0.3"       0.3
 "42"        "42"        42
 "0.3"       "0.3"       0.3

 "4z"        "4z"        4        (*)
 "4z3"       "4z3"       4        (*)
 "0.3y9"     "0.3y9"     0.3      (*)
 "xyz"       "xyz"       0        (*)
 ""          ""          0        (*)
 "23\n"      "23\n"      23
</code>

In all the cases where the string to number conversion is not perfect,
except the last one, perl will issue a warning. Well, assuming you turned
on <hl>use warnings</hl> as recommended.

<h2>Example</h2>

Now that you saw that table let's see it in code:

<code lang="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;

my $x = "4T";
my $y = 3;

</code>

Concatenation converts both values to strings:

<code lang="perl">
print $x . $y;    # 4T3
</code>

Numerical addition converts both values to numbers:

<code lang="perl">
print $x + $y;  # 7
                # Argument "4T" isn't numeric in addition (+) at ...
</code>

<h2>Argument isn't numeric</h2>

That's the warning you get when perl is trying to convert
a string to a number and the conversion isn't perfect.

There are a number of other common warnings and errors in Perl.
For example <a href="/global-symbol-requires-explicit-package-name">Global symbol requires explicit package name</a>
and <a href="/use-of-uninitialized-value">Use of uninitialized value</a>.

<h2>How to avoid the warning?</h2>

It is nice that perl will warn you (if asked to) when the type conversion was not perfect, but isn't there a function
like <b>is_number</b> that will check if the given string is really a number?

Yes and no.

Perl does not have an <b>is_number</b> function as that would be some kind of commitment that the Perl developers
know what is a number. Unfortunately the rest of the world cannot agree on this point exactly. There are systems
where ".2" is accepted as a number, but other system where that is not accepted.
Even more common that "2." is not accepted, but there are system where that is a perfectly acceptable number.

There are even places where 0xAB is considered a number. A Hexadecimal number.

So there is no <b>is_number</b> function, but there is a less committing functions called <b>looks_like_number</b>.

That's exactly what you think it is. It will check if the given string looks like a number for perl.

It is provided by the <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/Scalar/Util.html">Scalar::Util</a> module
and you can use it like this:

<code lang="perl">
use strict;
use warnings;

use Scalar::Util qw(looks_like_number);

print "How many loaves of bread shall I buy? ";
my $loaves = <STDIN>;
chomp $loaves;

if (looks_like_number($loaves)) {
    print "I am on it...\n";
} else {
    print "Sorry, I don't get it\n";
}
</code>

Don't forge the milk too!
