Ștefan Suciu owns a small IT consulting business in Brașov, Romania.
While currently the target market is focused on the other local small
businesses, a wider international target would be challenging.

<p>
He is also the author and/or contributor to a few open source projects
developed in Perl <a href="https://github.com/stefansbv">(GitHub)</a>
and one of the Romanian translators for the Perl Maven site.
